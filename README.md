[Infrared moving point target detection based on an anisotropic spatial-temporal fourth-order diffusion filter](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0045790617337898) by Zhu H et al in 2018.

The work proposed in this work is a temporal expansion on 'fourth-order diffusion filter' proposed in [An Anisotropic Fourth-Order Diffusion Filter for Image Noise Removal(AFDF)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11263-010-0330-1) by Hajiaboli. And source code of AFDF is also presented in this repository to help you understand its temporal-spatial version.
